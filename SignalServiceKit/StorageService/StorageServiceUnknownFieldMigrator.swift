/**
 * Utility class to simplify the transition when we start handling a previously-unknown storage
 * service field for the first time.
 *
 * ---
 * All this is rather complicated. Lets start with an example:
 *
 * Say we have some setting for dark mode (isDarkMode) on iOS and Desktop.
 * Desktop has been syncing the setting to storage service. iOS has not. We want to start syncing it.
 * Locally we have three states: UNSET, FALSE, TRUE.
 *
 * If we just naively added the field to our local proto definition, we'd recognize it the next time
 * we read from storage service, but our naive merging logic would overwrite our local state
 * with the state we see in storage service. Uh oh! We should respect local state!
 *
 * Ok so maybe we prefer local state for the primary, so we ignore the value when we read and
 * keep our local state instead. We do that, write our local state, Desktop reads it, and then the user
 * updates the value on Desktop. Next time we read from storage service on iOS...we drop the
 * value the user set on Desktop in favor of our local value! Uh oh!
 *
 * In short, what we need is to ignore the value on reads UNTIL we get a chance to write at least once,
 * and then we can start respecting the value on reads.
 * This class solves this problem generally.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Now, how does this class actually work? The scaffolding handles all the hooks for you so
 * that you can write a "migration" that does some subset of three things:
 * 1. ``MergeUnknownFields`` - do any special one-time handling the _first_ time we learn about
 *   some previously-unknown proto field. This lets you e.g. do any one-time merging of remote state
 *   into local state. In the isDarkMode example, we would take this opportunity to overwrite a local
 *   UNSET value with any value in storage service.
 *
 * Next are two methods that run on every record we read/write until we get the chance to successfully
 * write to storage service once. This lets us intercept records _before_ the standard merging code runs
 * and perform modifications while we are in this "in between" state when we first handle unknown fields.
 * 2. ``InterceptRemoteManifest`` - Take a record from a storage service manifest we fetched
 *   remotely and are about to merge with local state, and modify it _before_ we merge.
 *   In the isDarkMode example, we would overwrite the remote state with local state, so that the merge
 *   code always sees the remote state and local state as the same and changes nothing.
 * 3. ``InterceptLocalManifest`` - Take a record from a storage service manifest we generated
 *   locally and are about to _write_ to a remote, and modify it _before_ we write it.
 *   In the isDarkMode example we would do nothing in this step, but if we had some more complex merging
 *   logic that reconciles local and remote state, you could imagine this coming in handy.
 *
 * So the general flow is:
 * 1. Have some unknown field (isDarkMode) in storage service
 * 2. Update to a build that knows about this field for the first time
 * 3. Once, the _very first_ time on launch of this new build: run ``MergeUnknownFields`` providing
 *   all records with unknown fields. (May be empty. See ##Unknown Field Default Values## below).
 * 4. If we read from storage service: pass every read record to ``InterceptRemoteManifest`` before
 *   merging locally. (We pretend isDarkMode remote state is the same as local state so we never overwrite local state yet).
 * 5. If we write to storage service: pass every generated record to ``InterceptLocalManifest`` before
 *   writing remotely.
 * 6. Repeat 4 and 5 for every read/write until some write succeeds (step 3 is never repeated!)
 * 7. Succesfully write to storage service
 * 8. Done! Migration marked complete.
 *
 * To see this in pseudocode for the isDarkMode example, see the ``MigrationId.noOpExample`` migration below.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * There are some gotchas with ``MergeUnknownFields``.
 *
 * ##Unknown Field Default Values##
 *
 * One quirk of unknown fields in protos: if a field uses a primitive type (e.g. bool) and
 * is set to its default value (e.g. false), the serialized representation of that proto simply
 * omits the field entirely.
 * When a client that is unaware of the field parses such a proto, it doesn't know to
 * look for the field and doesn't see anything in the serialized bytes, so it has no idea
 * there is an unknown field at all.
 *
 * This means our "records with unknown fields" actually means "records with unknown
 * fields set to non-default values". So your ``MergeUnknownFields`` implementation
 * **SHOULD NOT** assume it is getting every record that had an unknown field; it only
 * gets those with non-default values. (And might actually be an empty array if all records
 * use default values!)
 *
 * What this means in practice is you should NOT write for loops over the passed in records;
 * instead you should loop over objects in our database (e.g. TSGroupThreads) and match those
 * against any passed in records (e.g. by groupId) and, if not present, assume the default value.
 *
 * ##Triggering Storage Service Writes##
 *
 * Most of the time, if you're merging remote state in ``MergeUnknownFields``, you will want
 * to write back the results of the merge to storage service. The way to do this is to mark any updated
 * record as needing an update via normal mechanisms, e.g. for the local account record you would call
 * `storageServiceManager.recordPendingLocalAccountUpdates()`
