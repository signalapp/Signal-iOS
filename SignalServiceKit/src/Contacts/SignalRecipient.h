/// SignalRecipient serves two purposes:

/// a) It serves as a cache of "known" Signal accounts.  When the service indicates
///    that an account exists, we make sure that an instance of SignalRecipient exists
///    for that recipient id (using mark as registered) and has at least one device.
///    When the service indicates that an account does not exist, we remove any devices
///    from that SignalRecipient - but do not remove it from the database.
///    Note that SignalRecipients without any devices are not considered registered.
/// b) We hang the "known device list" for known signal accounts on this entity.
