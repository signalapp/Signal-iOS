    // * The "will become ready" blocks are called before the "did become ready" blocks.
    // * The "will become ready" blocks should be used for internal setup of components
    //   so that they are ready to interact with other components of the system.
    // * The "will become ready" blocks should never use other components of the system.
    //
    // * The "did become ready" blocks should be used for any work that should be done
    //   on app launch, especially work that uses other components.
    // * We should usually use "did become ready" blocks since they are safer.
    //
    // * We should use the "polite" flavor of "did become ready" blocks when the work
    //   can be safely delayed for a second or two after the app becomes ready.
    // * We should use the "polite" flavor of "did become ready" blocks wherever possible
    //   since they avoid a stampede of activity on launch.
