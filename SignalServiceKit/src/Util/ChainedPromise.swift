/// Wraps a promise to execute promises sequentially in a thread-safe way.
///
/// When a closure which returns a promise is enqueued on the `ChainedPromise`,
/// the closure itself will not be executed until all previously enqueued promises have
/// been resolved. (Note that failures are ignored)
/// In other words, you "enqueue" blocks of work whose results are represented by
/// promises, and guarantee that they are executed serially with FIFO.
///
/// Enqueue calls are thread-safe.
///
/// WARNING: for this reason, if an enqueued closure returns a promise that never resolves,
/// the entire chain will be left waiting forever.
///
/// For example, consider the following sequence of calls:
/// ```
/// let chainedPromise = ChainedPromise<Void>()
/// let createFilePromise = chainedPromise.enqueue {
///     self.createFileOnDisk()
/// }
/// let validateFilePromise = chainedPromise.enqueue {
///     self.validateFileOnDisk()
/// }
/// ```
/// In this example, the call to `validateFileOnDisk` will not be executed until
/// the promise returned by `createFileOnDisk` is resolved (whether success or failure).
/// Anything enqueued afterwards will wait on the resolution of the promise returned by
/// `validateFileOnDisk`.
