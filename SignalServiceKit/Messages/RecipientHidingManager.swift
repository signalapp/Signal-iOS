// Recipient hiding (also called "contact hiding," "contact management," or
// "contact removal/deletion" by Product) is a feature that allows users to
// remove a recipient from certain UI surfaces without fully blocking them.
// Namely, hidden recipients will not appear in the user's recipient picker
// lists, such when picking a person to whom to send a message. The hidden
// user can still send a message to the user who hid them, but it appears
// in the message request state. A hidden user becomes like someone with
// whom you've never exchanged messages before: this is the guiding principle
// behind how hidden users should be treated in the app.
