/**
 `MMDrawerController` is a side drawer navigation container view controller designed to support the growing number of applications that leverage the side drawer paradigm. This library is designed to exclusively support side drawer navigation in light-weight, focused approach.
 
 ## Creating a MMDrawerController
 `MMDrawerController` is a container view controller, similiar to `UINavigationController` or `UITabBarController`, with up to three child view controllers - Center, LeftDrawer, and RightDrawer. To create a `MMDrawerController`, you must first instantiate the drawer view controllers and the initial center controller, then call one of the init methods listed in this class.

 ## Handling a UINavigationController as the centerViewController
 `MMDrawerController` automatically supports handling a `UINavigationController` as the `centerViewController`, and will correctly handle the proper gestures on each view (the navigation bar view as well as the content view for the visible view controller). Note that while this library does support other container view controllers, the open/close gestures are not customized to support them.
 
 ## Accessing MMDrawerController from the Child View Controller
 You can leverage the category class (UIViewController+MMDrawerController) included with this library to access information about the parent `MMDrawerController`. Note that if you are contained within a UINavigationController, the `drawerContainerViewController` will still return the proper reference to the `drawerContainerViewController` parent, even though it is not the direct parent. Refer to the documentation included with the category for more information.

 ## How MMDrawerOpenCenterInteractionMode is handled
 `MMDrawerOpenCenterInteractionMode` controls how the user should be able to interact with the center view controller when either drawer is open. By default, this is set to `MMDrawerOpenCenterInteractionModeNavigationBarOnly`, which allows the user to interact with UINavigationBarItems while either drawer is open (typicaly used to click the menu button to close). If you set the interaction mode to `MMDrawerOpenCenterInteractionModeNone`, no items within the center view will be able to be interacted with while a drawer is open. Note that this setting has no effect at all on the `MMCloseDrawerGestureMode`.
 
 ## How Open/Close Gestures are handled
 Two gestures are added to every instance of a drawer controller, one for pan and one for touch. `MMDrawerController` is the delegate for each of the gesture recoginzers, and determines if a touch should be sent to the appropriate gesture when a touch is detected compared with the masks set for open and close gestures and the state of the drawer controller.
 
 ## Integrating with State Restoration
 In order to opt in to state restoration for `MMDrawerController`, you must set the `restorationIdentifier` of your drawer controller. Instances of your centerViewController, leftDrawerViewController and rightDrawerViewController must also be configured with their own `restorationIdentifier` (and optionally a restorationClass) if you intend for those to be restored as well. If your MMDrawerController had an open drawer when your app was sent to the background, that state will also be restored.
 
 ## What this library doesn't do.
 This library is not meant for:
    - Top or bottom drawer views
    - Displaying both drawers at one time
    - Displaying a minimum drawer width
    - Support container view controllers other than `UINavigationController` as the center view controller.
