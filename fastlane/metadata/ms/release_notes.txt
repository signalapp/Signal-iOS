• Now you can edit a message with a long press after it has been sent! Fix a tpyo, include the missing ingredient in grandma's chocolate chip cookie recipe, or add the punchline to a joke if you hit the send button too quickly. The choice is yours. Messages will always show when they have been edited, and you can tap on the "Edited" indicator to see the full edit history for any edited messages. Update the past in the present to prevent future confusion today!
• Only you can truly find yourself, but we added a check mark badge that can help you find your “Note to Self.”
