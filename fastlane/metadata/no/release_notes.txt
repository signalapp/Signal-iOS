• Signal polls are here! Are you and your friends on the same page, or are you poll-ar opposites? Polls are an easy way to see what your group chat really thinks. Create a poll with competing dinner options, vacation destinations, musical preferences for an upcoming road trip, or any other important choices. Everyone in the group can vote and see each other's responses, and you can decide whether or not to allow multiple votes.
• This update also includes the first wave of the Liquid Glass redesign for iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 with refined animations and new visual elements. Future releases will have even more improvements, but if you're thirsty for a new look then this Liquid Glass should already be pretty refreshing.
