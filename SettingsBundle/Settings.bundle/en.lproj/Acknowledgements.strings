Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure thatyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and chargefor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can getit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces ofit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can dothese things.";
"Spandsp9" = "  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbiddistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender theserights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities foryou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.";

If you link other code with the library, you must providecomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink themwith the library after making changes to the library and recompilingit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.";

Also, if the library ismodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should knowthat what they have is not the original version, so that the originalauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might beintroduced by others.  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence ofany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannoteffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining arestrictive license from a patent holder.

"Spandsp14" = "  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or usinga shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking acombined work, a derivative of the original library.

The Lesser GeneralPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code withthe library.";

These disadvantagesare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for manylibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certainspecial circumstances.";
"Spandsp16" = "  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need toencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomesa de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must beallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a freelibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In thiscase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to freesoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.";
"Spandsp17" = "  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-freeprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body offree software.

"Spandsp31" = "    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the    application.

If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patentinfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement orotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do notexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannotdistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under thisLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence youmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patentlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library byall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, thenthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be torefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.";
